# CS 142 Lab 3

## Tic Tac Toe

In this lab, you will play and modify a game already written for you in Java.  Through 
playing the game and investigating the code, you will practice with using functions, Java 
objects, calling instance methods, and multidimensional arrays.

### Getting started

1. Start IntelliJ.  Load up the same project you were using for lab 2.  Otherwise, you
may start a new project by following the lab 2 directions and using the same URL.

2. In the left-hand panel, expand the `src` folder to see today's lab 
    (in the `lab3` folder).  Double-click on `TicTacToe` (not the `md`
    file yet.)  If you get a yellow bar at the top that says "Project JDK is
    not defined," then click on "Setup SDK" and choose the JDK you downloaded
    earlier.

3. In the left-hand panel, double-click on `TicTacToe.md`.  Follow
    the instructions in this file.  This is where you will answer the questions
    for the lab.

**Note**: You do not need to open the `SimpleCanvas` file.

### Submitting the lab

When you and your partner are done, please turn in the `TicTacToe.java` file and 
the `TicTacToe.md` file to canvas.
